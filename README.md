# TCR structural redundancy evaluation
These codes contains the experimental codes of Explainable Methods for Evaluating Structural Redundancy of CNNs. The codes runs on Tensorflow 2.7 and python 3.7.0, they also relies on pandas, scipy and libraries. The dataset used in this paper is CIFAR-10. 
# Introduction of TCR structural redundancy evalution 
As a method for evaluat structural redundancy, the TCR evaluation method is based on the CNN structured pruning algorithm and the linear probe method. By analyzing whether the channel outputs can have effective outputs that can assist the network in classification, it realizes the construction of quantitative criteria for the contribution of channels to the network. Based on this, a method for evaluating the redundancy of network substructures and a method for structuring pruning of the network are constructed to achieve the evaluation of structural redundancy of the entire network and its substructures.
